Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent this issue from happening again, the following corrective and preventative measures will be taken:
(1)	The Nginx web server code will be patched to fix the memory leak.
	A monitoring system will be implemented to detect memory leaks in the Nginx web server.
	The Nginx web server will be configured with a lower memory limit to prevent it from crashing due to memory exhaustion.
(2)	The MySQL database configuration will be reviewed and updated to ensure that it is correct.
	A monitoring system will be implemented to detect misconfigurations in the MySQL database.
	A backup of the MySQL database will be created to restore the database in the event of a corruption.

Tasks to Address the Issue
The following tasks will be completed to address the issue:
(1)	Patch the Nginx web server code to fix the memory leak.	
	Implement a monitoring system to detect memory leaks in the Nginx web server.
	Configure the Nginx web server with a lower memory limit.
(2)	Review and update the MySQL database configuration.
	Implement a monitoring system to detect misconfigurations in the MySQL database.
